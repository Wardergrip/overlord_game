# Ratchet & Clank

This is the assignment I made for Graphics Programming 2. The task was to remake a small part of a game. The most important part was polish and applying techniques and theory we saw like particles, shadow mapping and post processing. The assignment is made in Overlord engine which is a component based C++ engine made by the teachers.
